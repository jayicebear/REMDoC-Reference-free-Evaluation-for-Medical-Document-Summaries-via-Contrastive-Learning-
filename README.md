Despite the advancement of automatic summarization methods based on pre-
trained language models, evaluating their effectiveness remains a challenge, particularly
in the absence of a medical document reference-free summary evaluation metric. In this
paper, we propose a novel reference-free medical document summary evaluation metric,
REMDoC: Reference-free Evaluation for Medical Document Summaries via Contrastive
Learning which does not require reference summaries to evaluate summaries. REMDoC
employs contrastive learning using medical text-tailored data augmentation techniques.
Our research showcases the metricâ€™s superior performance in assessing the quality of
generated summaries without the need for comparison texts. Through extensive experi-
mentation and analysis, this work makes significant strides in improving the reliability and
usability of automatic medical document evaluation tools in medical document settings.
